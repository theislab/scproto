## Overview

Single-cell RNA-seq data is often **noisy**, **sparse**, and affected by **batch effects**, which can obscure meaningful biological insights.  
**scProto** is an interpretable self-supervised prototype learning method that learns biologically meaningful **prototypes** and decodes them into **metacells** â€” compact, denoised representations of cell populations across batches.

- Learns **cross-batch metacells** that reflect biologically meaningful cell groups  
- Trained to **preserve biological structure** and **cell-cell relationships** in the embedding space while mitigating batch effects  
- Fully **label-free**, requiring no annotations  

## Key Features

- **Interpretable prototype learning** and **metacell decoding** across datasets  
- Embedding space that maintains **biological topology** and **local cell relationships**  
- Enhances single-cell analysis by **denoising gene expression** and **overcoming data sparsity**
